##Dim Secondary Screens

Simple Autohotkey script to place a black GUI over all secondary monitors for when you want to game or work without physically turning your monitors off or minimising other distractions.

Alt+x to toggle on/off

Requires [Autohotkey](http://ahkscript.org/) to run since you probably shouldn't trust .exe files from some random guy on the internet.
